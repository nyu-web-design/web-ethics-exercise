# Web Ethics Exercise

You will research and present an ethical issue related to the Internet and/or The Web. The group will discuss and debate this issue during the class session.

## Issue overview

TBD by you. See instructions below.

## Requirements

Do the following:

- Write a one-paragraph summary of the issue into the `## Issue overview` section above.

  - Use nicely-formatted Markdown code. Review any [reasonably-decent tutorial](https://www.markdownguide.org/) if you need help.

- Explain the positions of at least two sides of the debate over the issue, each in its own paragraph.

  - If you cannot find at least two conflicting perspectives on your chosen issue, you should choose a different issue!
  - Include links to at least two articles available online that discuss the two sides of this issue you have mentioned.

- Post your first paragraph to the class's Slack workspace, in the `#ethics` channel.
- No two students are allowed to bring up the same ethical issue... we take a first-come-first-served policy, and it is the duty of all students to verify that no other student has posted the same issue before them.
- Prepare to introduce and moderate a short discussion of the issue during the class session.
